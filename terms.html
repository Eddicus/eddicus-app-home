              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
                apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
                carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
                modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
                way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
                the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself,
                and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
                intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
                Eddicus.

              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                Eddicus is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
                efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
                make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
                time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or
                its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
                you’re paying for.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                The Eddicus - Business Edition app stores and processes personal
                data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our
                Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access
                to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
                jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
                software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
                operating system of your device. It could make your phone
                vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
                your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
                Eddicus - Business Edition app won’t work properly or at all.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                You should be aware that there are certain things that Eddicus
                will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app
                will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
                connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
                provider, but Eddicus cannot take responsibility for the app not
                working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
                and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px"></p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
                duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
                third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
                not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
                please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                from the bill payer for using the app.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                Along the same lines, Eddicus cannot always take responsibility
                for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
                device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
                turn it on to avail the Service, Eddicus cannot accept
                responsibility.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                With respect to Eddicus’s responsibility for your use of the
                app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
                that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                information to us so that we can make it available to you.
                Eddicus accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
                functionality of the app.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p style="font-size: 14px">
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android – the requirements for system
                (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
                availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
                download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Eddicus
                does not promise that it will always update the app so that it
                is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that
                you have installed on your device. However, you promise to
                always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
                may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use
                of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
                you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                device.
