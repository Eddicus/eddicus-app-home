                We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a
                case of an error in the app we collect data and information
                (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.
                This Log Data may include information such as your device
                Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system
                version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our

              </p>
              <p class="mt-4"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
              <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
                used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
                device's internal memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You
                have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and
                know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
                to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions
                of this Service.

              <p class="mt-4"><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
              <p>
                We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
                following reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
                have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to
                perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
                are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any
                other purpose.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4"><strong>Security</strong></p>
              <p>
                We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information,
                thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
                protecting it. But keep in mind that no method of transmission
                over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
                secure and reliable. So while we cannot give a 100% certain and
                absolute guarantee over its security, we can guarantee that
                we'll always strive to ensure we put in place the best security
                measures in the industry, by global standards. And if anything
                at all should happen to your data without your consent, we are
                committing ourselves to alerting you right away.
